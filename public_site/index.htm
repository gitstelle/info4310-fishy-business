                            in 2013 was about 327, 400 tonnes, and Aquaculture production was about 60, 300 tonnes in
                            2014. In 2014, imports were valued at 4.0 billion USD, whereas exports generated over 4.6
                            billion USD, going mostly to European countries.

                            style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;width:100%;"> Norway, in terms of value, is the
                            world's second largest exporter of fish and fish products by value. In 2009, Norwegian
                            production of farmed salmon had reached almost 860,000 tonnes, with the export value of
                            salmon and trout at almost 4.0 billion USD. The fisheries sector is the second largest
                            single export industry, after oil and gas, and represented 5.7 percent of total Norwegian
                            exports in 2009.

                        <p>Aquacultures, or farm-raised fish tend to be a more sustainable option because they reduce
                            stress on wild fish populations and their involvement in the marine food web. However,
                            aquacultures can harm the environment with contamination and waste, and can provide less
                            nutrients than capture fisheries.</p>
